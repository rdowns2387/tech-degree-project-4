This is the Legend of Zelda guessing game!

The Legend of Zelda has been a part of my life since my youth. While I haven't played all of the games in the extensive series, I thought the different titles of the games would make great phrases to guess and show off what I've learned in terms of object oriented programming.

I edited the original css and html of the TreeHouse Full-stack Tech Degree Unit 4 Project, OOP Game Show, to pull in some Zelda visuals:
- the many iterations of Link throughout the years on the game's start screen
- the game's iconic heart containers in place of the provided heart images
- the game over background image to reflect the Game Over screen all Zelda fans know and love
